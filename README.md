## Notes by repository owner
- English is not my main language.
- I am new in JavaScript and NodeJS.
- I am not using a paid VPS to keep this bot up. This bot is very limited for some things such as multi guild support with database, saving guild settings to somewhere is not possible.
- Command names will be English, but aliases may contain other languages such as Turkish.
- Variables, functions, modules etc. will be English but their content (Like messages.) may be Turkish.
